- ### **Lack of Transparency**  
  Charity platforms often fail to clearly show where funds go and how its managed, leading to distrust and reduced donor participation.

  Traditional aid processes are slow and fragmented, making it hard to get help to the right people at the right time.

- ### **Limited Accessibility & Inclusivity**  
  Rural and underserved communities are often excluded from digital charity platforms due to technological and financial limitations.
